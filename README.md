# SIL

*SIL* is a mod for *Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead*.

*SIL* adds the Sliding Instant Legolas, commercially known as [the Fenris](https://gogun.co/collections/fenris-magazine-and-accessories/products/fenris-bow-magazine-limited-edition), as well as a recipe to attach it to the only compound bow currently in the game.

It does not add the SIL, or bows with it, to spawn. You must spawn it manually via the debug menu to use it. *Pull requests adding items into spawn lists are welcome.*


## What is the SIL

The SIL is a five-arrow magazine for compound bows, allowing shooter to fire several arrows in quick succession. It is quiet to draw, and the nature of the SIL makes the bow require slightly less strength (âˆ’1 relative to in-game compound bow) to drwa. It also offers a sight rail for short- and medium-range firearm sights, thus noticably improving potential accuracy.

Reloading the empty magazine is about as slow as reloading the drum of a revolver.

The SIL is at its most useful during hunting, as it allows your character to launch several arrows on the target without interrupting the sight picture. It may offer an advantage over a single non-wildlife opponent or a couple of weaker ones.


## Potential improvements

* a cheaper 3D-printed version, as seen [here](https://legolini.com/sil_hybrid_bow.php)
* arrow clips: quicker reloading in the field
* laser sight, as in the commercial version
* miniature crossbow of the same nature
